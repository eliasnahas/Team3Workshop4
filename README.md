# Team 3 Workshop 4 and 5 for OOSD 2023/24

This is a repository for both parts of the
second threaded project for Team 3 of the
2023/24 OOSD program.

There is a Visual Studio C# Windows Forms
application, as well as an
ASP.NET Core MVC Website.

Please run the SQLCreateAndUpdateScript.sql
file to update the Travel Experts database
on your local machine prior to running.

Additionally, you'll need to set the
start up project as either the
Windows Forms or the MVC Website.
You'll also need to comment or uncomment
the lines in the Context file.
